# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

This repository is a *comprehensive collection* of my work completed during the **Introduction to Robotics** course, which I undertook in my third year at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science**, **University of Bucharest**. Here, you'll find *meticulously documented assignments*, each encompassing detailed requirements, thorough implementation insights, and comprehensive sets of code and accompanying image files. 

> Thee shalt find delecting insights within these medieval translation: *Hark, fair gentlefolk! This compendium doth contain a thorough assemblage of mine toils completed whilst I did engage in the Introduction to Robotics course during mine third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Within these hallowed pages, thou shalt discover diligently chronicled tasks, each possessing detailed decrees, profound insights into their construction, and ample scrolls of code accompanied by likenesses captured in image files.*

## Homework 1

### Task assignment
The first homework involved creating the current repository, making it private, providing access to ten github users (nine teacher assistants and the course professor) and writing a succinct yet creative `README.md`. 

## Homework 2

### Task assignment
This assignment focused on controlling the intensity of *each color* of an **RGB LED** with an *individual potentiometer*. The control was achieved indirectly through an Arduino. The task involved reading three values from analog pins and **mapping** them to match the output capabilities of the **PWM** (*Pulse Width Modulation*) digital pins. </br>
**Additional information** about each input/output and its *respective port* can be found in the introductory comments of the `RGB-LED.ino` file in the `Homework\Homework-2` folder.

### Setup
The setup included:
  - arduino uno board
  - medium breadboard
  - 1 x RGB LED
  - 3 x potentiometer
  - 1 x 330 Ω resistor (for the red channel)
  - 2 x 220 Ω resistor (one for the blue chanel, and one for the green chanel)
  - 14 x short/medium cable 
  - 1 x USB A to B cable
