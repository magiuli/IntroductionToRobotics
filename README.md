# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

This repository is a *comprehensive collection* of my work completed during the **Introduction to Robotics** course, which I undertook in my third year at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science**, **University of Bucharest**. Here, you'll find *meticulously documented assignments*, each encompassing detailed requirements, thorough implementation insights, and comprehensive sets of code and accompanying image files. 

> Thee shalt find delecting insights within these medieval translation: *Hark, fair gentlefolk! This compendium doth contain a thorough assemblage of mine toils completed whilst I did engage in the Introduction to Robotics course during mine third year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Within these hallowed pages, thou shalt discover diligently chronicled tasks, each possessing detailed decrees, profound insights into their construction, and ample scrolls of code accompanied by likenesses captured in image files.*

## Homework 1

### Task assignment
The first homework involved creating the current repository, making it private, providing access to ten github users (nine teacher assistants and the course professor) and writing a succinct yet creative `README.md`. 

## Homework 2

### Task assignment
This assignment focused on controlling the intensity of *each color* of an **RGB LED** with an *individual potentiometer*. The control was achieved indirectly through an Arduino. The task involved reading three values from analog pins and **mapping** them to match the output capabilities of the **PWM** (*Pulse Width Modulation*) digital pins. </br>
**Additional information** about each input/output and its *respective port* can be found in the introductory comments of the `RGB-LED.ino` file in the `Homework\Code` folder.

### Setup
The setup included:
  - arduino uno board
  - medium breadboard
  - 1 x RGB LED
  - 3 x potentiometer
  - 1 x 330 立 resistor (for the red channel)
  - 2 x 220 立 resistor (one for the blue chanel, and one for the green chanel)
  - 14 x short/medium cable 
  - 1 x USB A to B cable

## Homework 3

### Task assignment

This assignment involved simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with an Arduino. Each LED and button represents one of the three floors, with the LED corresponding to the current floor lighting up.Additionally, there is a 4th LED that signifies the operational state of the elevator: it blinks when the elevator is in motion and remains off when stationary. When the elevator begins moving, it 'closes the doors,' 'travels' to the desired floor, and announces 'the arrival.' Each of these quoted actions has its corresponding sound.

While the elevator is stationary, pressing the button for the current floor results in no action. However, pressing a button while the elevator is in motion places the requested floor in a queue for following action.

### Setup
The setup included:
  - arduino uno board
  - medium breadboard
  - 3 x blue LED
  - 1 x red LED
  - 1 x active buzzer
  - 3 x button
  - 2 x 220 立 resistor (one for the red LED and one for the zctive buzzer)
  - 3 x 1000 立 resistor (one for each blue led)
  - 13 x short cable 
  - 1 x USB A to B cable

## Homework 4

### Task assignment

This homework assignment involves controlling a 7-segment display using a joystick. The joystick allows you to move the active segment and "draw" on the display. The movement between segments is restricted to natural transitions, meaning the segment can only jump to neighboring positions without passing through "walls."Here are the key functionalities of the assignment:
 
  - The initial position of the segment is at the decimal point (DP).
  - The current segment always blinks, regardless of its state (on or off).
  - Use the joystick to move the current position to neighboring segments, based on a predefined table of corresponding movements.
  - A short press of the joystick button toggles the state of the current segment from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON.
  - A long press of the joystick button resets the entire display by turning off all the segments and moving the current position back to the decimal point (DP).

### Setup
